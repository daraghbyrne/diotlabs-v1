title: "2. LEDs Continued"

We've made our first (and incredibly basic) connected appliance - a light that we can turn on and off remotely through the internet. But woudln't it be nice if we could do a little more with it, like be able to fade it up and down or be able to mix in color and set a mood.

In this mix of tutorials and guides, we'll explore Pulse Width Modulation as a way to control the fading of an LED and introduce RGB LEDs (3 component LEDs where red, green and blue light emitters can be mixed),


### Components you will need
