In this section, we'll start with the basics of electronics, hardware and introduce the Particle platform. At the end of this section, you'll find the first set of guides and tutorials to help you build your first internet appliance - a connected light!

## New to electronics?

{% include note.html type="warning" title="Warning" text="If you've never worked with electronics before, there's __two things__ you should really read first." %}

* [What is Electricity?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6TEooUr0_sSd2FNMVQ3eFFpVGM/view?usp=sharing) - An excellent summary excerpted from [Massimo Banzi's Getting Started With Arduino](http://phylab.fudan.edu.cn/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=yuandi:arduino:getting_started_with_arduino_v2.pdf)

* Sparkfun’s ['What is a Circuit?'](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit?_ga=1.33498942.1082077783.1413566402) is a great guide to the basics of electronics, circuity and the underlying concepts. 

#### Equipment

These guides and labs are designed for use with the [Particle IoT Framework](http://particle.io) and have been updated for the [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/prototype#photon) development board.

These tutorials assume you are using a [Particle Maker Kit](https://store.particle.io/collections/shields-and-kits) or have access to these components.
